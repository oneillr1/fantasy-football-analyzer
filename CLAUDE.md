## Code Memories

### Fantasy Analyzer Project
- Encountered an error while working on fantasy_analyzer.py
- Recommended targeted approach to fix the file:
  * Complete any unfinished functions around line 1718
  * Verify and correct syntax 
  * Test ADP differential calculation
  * Implement overall profile scoring system

### Testing/Feedback System
- Added `run_scoring_test()` method to randomly select 3 players and output detailed scoring breakdown
- Added `enable_testing_mode` parameter to FantasyFootballAnalyzer constructor
- Testing system shows individual scoring components:
  * Historical Performance (25% weight)
  * Advanced Metrics (30% weight) 
  * ML Predictions (30% weight)
  * Injury Profile (15% weight)
- Each component shows detailed calculation and final weighted score

#### How to Use Testing Mode:
1. **Enable Testing**: Set `enable_testing_mode=True` when creating analyzer
   ```python
   analyzer = FantasyFootballAnalyzer("fantasy_data", enable_testing_mode=True)
   ```
2. **Run Test**: Call `analyzer.run_scoring_test()` or run the script - it will automatically test
3. **Disable Testing**: Set `enable_testing_mode=False` for full analysis (default)

#### Testing Commands:
- Quick test: `analyzer.run_scoring_test()`
- Test with more players: `analyzer.run_scoring_test(5)`
- Toggle testing in main script by changing `enable_testing_mode=True/False` on line 3499

#### Testing Output:
- Randomly selects 3 players from top 30 at each position
- Shows detailed breakdown of all scoring components
- Displays final score (/10) and star rating (★★★★★)
- Easy to evaluate scoring logic and provide feedback
